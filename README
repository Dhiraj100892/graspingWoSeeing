Detailed information about how the data is organized.

Structure of dataset
====================
For a given object X and trial Y, here’s the folder structure
obj_X/
  metadata, material, trial_Y/
                        data.p, haptics/, images/

The folder haptics/ contains the bag files with raw sensor data recordings and a plot of their data.


Structure of data file
====================
All other data related to the trial can be found in the picklefile called data.p. An example, and the description of each value, is shown below:

{
  'delta':
    {           # re-grasp params  [x, y, z  in meters, theta in radians], 1 is initial grasp
      1: [0.018, 0.028, -0.213, -0.083],
      2: [-0.008, -0.0149, 0.0225, -0.030]
    },
  'f': 
    {          # Robotiq finger positions (range 0-255), ‘B’ is the middle finger
      1: {'A': 47, 'B': 57, 'C': 46, 'all': 47},
      2: {'A': 58, 'B': 68, 'C': 58, 'all': 58}
    },
 'grasp_success_contact':  #Before lifting object
    True,
 'grasp_success_final': #After lifting object
    False,
 'h': # See https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01354
    0.20,   
 'initial_haptic_bias':
    {     # Initial bias for 
      'left': [-0.006, -0.006, -0.002],
      'middle': [-0.007, -0.002, -0.023],
      'right': [-0.01 , -0.007,  0.016]
    },
 'mode': # There are 3 modes for the Robotiq gripper (see paper)
    1,
 'num_grasps': # total number of grasps, including initial grasp
    2,
 'theta': # theta (in radians) of initial planar grasp, i.e. angle about vertical axis
    -1.75,
 'x': # Object location with respect to robot base link
    0.557,
 'y': # Object location with respect to robot base link
    0.101
